A data analysis project where I performed EDA and feature engineering on Google Play dataset.


Main Objectives are:
1. Understand the structure and patterns in data.
2. Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
3. Perform univariate and multivariate analysis
4. Engineer new features to improve predictive performance
5. Prepare data for modeling

Dataset:
Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps
Shape: (10841, 13)
Features: App, Category, Rating, Installs, etc.

Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn (for encoding/scaling)
5. Jupyter Notebook

Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights:
1. Distribution of ratings
2. Relationship between installs and app ratings
3. Insights from categorical features
